# Terms and Definitions

## Brand Awareness

Quite simply, [brand awareness](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/brand-awareness/) measures how familiar people are with your brand or product. If people recognize your product’s name, or if they can point it out on a shelf, you have an advantage over brands that people don’t recognize or can’t name.

Brand awareness indicates the health of a brand and is a common tool to measure the effectiveness of advertising. Say your company has invested heavily in a TV advertising and print campaign to promote your bottled water brand.

One way to tell if the campaign was effective is to send out a [brand awareness survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/measure-brand-awareness-build-brand-power/), following the campaign, to find out if people recognize your brand. If they do recognize the brand, you have a solid indication that your campaign is noteworthy and that people recall the brand because they saw and paid attention to the advertisements.

### Unaided vs Aided

To really gauge how impressionable your brand is, you will want to test unaided and aided brand awareness in your survey.

#### Unaided brand awareness (aka brand recall)

A measure of the number of people who express knowledge of a brand or product without prompting. Unprompted or spontaneous awareness questions do not mention a brand name but ask consumers to name brands they are aware of in a given category.&#x20;

Examples would be “could you tell name ten airlines that you are aware of” or “can you name five soft drinks brands”.

#### Aided brand awareness (ak brand recognition)

A measure of the number of people who express knowledge of a brand or product when prompted.

Examples would be "which of these brands are you familiar with" followed by a list of brands.

## Brand Consideration

Consideration examines whether consumers would consider purchasing a brand they are aware of. Here we see the hierarchical nature of the funnel in action; it is not possible to consider a brand you are not aware of.&#x20;

Consideration questions might ask “of the ten airline brands you are aware of, which would you consider using?”

## Gross Rating Point (GRP)

"One GRP is one percent of all potential adult television viewers (or in radio, listeners) in a market." If they are exposed to the ad three times, then that is 3 GRPs.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross\_rating\_point#cite\_note-GRP.NYT76-2)

GRPs are simply total impressions related to the size of the target population: They are most directly calculated by summing the ratings of individual ads in a campaign.

Mathematically:GRPs (%) = 100 \* Impressions (#) ÷ Defined population (#)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross\_rating\_point#cite\_note-Marketing\_Metrics-3)GRPs (%) = 100 \* Reach (%) × Average frequency (#)

Two examples:

* If an average of 12% of the people view each episode of a television program, and an ad is placed on 5 episodes, then the campaign has 12 × 5 = 60 GRPs.
* If 50% view three episodes, that's 150 GRPs.

## Target Rating Point (TRP)

Percentage of the **target audience** reached reached by a campaign.   AKA a Television Rating Point.

## Media Buying - TV

### Upfront vs Scatter

**Upfront:** typically purchased May-July for an October-September broadcast year.  Provides greatest access to inventory at most efficient pricing with cancellation options built into deal terms.  80-85% of all TV inventory is sold in upfronts.

* **Broadcast Year Upfront:** purchased May-July for upcoming broadcast season (covers 80-85% of all)
* **Calendar Year Upfront:** purchased Oct-Nov for upcoming broadcast season.

**Scatter: **Inventory is sold throughout the year with potential for high inflation pending marketplace conditions.  Unpredictable rates and avails, pricing premiums 10%-100%  Non-cancellable once committed.

## Audience

The [demographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic) of a particular audience is often notated in an abbreviated form, e.g.:

* P2+ = Persons aged 2 or more
* P12–34 = Persons aged 12 to 34
* P18–49 = Persons aged 18 to 49
* A18–34 = Adults aged 18 to 34
