# Overview

## Goals

*   **RFP a measurement vendor** to produce the brand lift studies.

    * **Neilsen**
    * **ComScore**

    ****
* **Issue Measurement Plan**
  * Local Linear TV
  * Digital Extensions
    * need to discuss with Christina on who’s doing that work. The we’ll need to decide upon format, syncing with the TV data (reporting from TV delayed a full quarter) .. careful how we’re advising optimizations and action based on these delays.\

* **Establish benchmarks for brand lift**
  * Here’s some questions I have, some data we’d like to see in order to prep and contextualize what we’ll be doing.   Establishing benchmarks .. what _should_ we be expecting to see if we’re accomplishing our objectives?  &#x20;
    * Kantar said benchmark was awareness was +0.6 points for retail — which might be true but not necessarily impressive.
    * Competitive data .. Dick's Sporting Goods etc
    * Sales history for forecasting .. seasonality etc.  \

* **Build roadmap of additional analysis, research**&#x20;
  * 2 to 3-week intervals from now through the 'main analysis/forecast'
  * External research
    * MRI (MediaMark Research Intelligence .. aka [GFK](https://www.gfk.com/en-us/home)?)
    * GWI ([GlobalWebIndex](https://www.globalwebindex.com))
    * [eMarketer](https://www.emarketer.com)
  * Internal tools
    * ROI Modeler
    * Scenario Planner.&#x20;
  * Creative, bootstrappy solutions\

* **Final deliverable;** run 8 weeks, get results back, in-house analysis on their sales in those markets; our role is to balloon that outward and predict results on a full-nation basis, forecast the effect on 2022.  (Delivery by end of Oct, enough time to impact holiday planning)

## **Current **Situation

The brand has been pigeonholed not being able to sell to Men .. attempting to migrate from a yoga pants company for women to an athletic wear company for everyone.&#x20;

Which means big-ticket, brand awareness and perception changing campaigns, which is where we come in.

Right now media has _not_ launched; we need a vendor to provide that attribution, measurement. Vetted 4 vendors including Neilsen, Kantar, ComScore and DataPlusMath (measures effects of TV on conversion).

However their finance team got cold feet. Was scheduled for June, now looking at August for product-specific advertising in specific markets; some OOO, targeted streaming audio, _local_ digital tv. Still need an awareness measurement (probably ComScore or Kantar) .. run 8 weeks, get results back, in-house analysis on their sales in those markets; our role is to balloon that outward and predict results on a full-nation basis, forecast the effect on 2022.

Looking at digital and terrestrial radio and tv; change perceptions in the long run but also have impact on the lower funnel in the short run.

We’ll have access to internal tools for competitive research and planning that they _don’t_ have; MRI, GWI, eMarketer, internal tools like ROI Modeler and Scenario Planner.

“Droga5” is a creative partner (part of Accenture, watch out ..)
