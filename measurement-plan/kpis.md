# Outline

### Target Rating Point (TRP)

"We're planning 60 Linear TRPs per week per market for 12 weeks.   Ends up being 720 TRPs total, or 240 TRPs monthly.   This doesn't inclide CTV/OTT, just Linear TV"



### Brand Awareness

\[John Nuding] "An old norm for awareness lift/decay for CPG (base on Milward Brown AI score) is 4-5 build with a decay of 8-10.  This is simplified as a 4-5% increase per week/per 100 GRPs, and a decay of 8-10% of awareness per week."

\[Nick] "We reached out to KMB for benchmarks and they gave us a heavily-qualified benchmark for +0.6% for unaided awareness. &#x20;

### Media Strategy

The main audience target (i.e. Strategic Demo) for the brand campaign is a segment titled "Balance Seekers"

* Details here ...

In channels where we can't buy against the Strategic Demo, we'll target the broader age demo of 18-49.

Local Linear TV for the most part, plus some local digital "extensions" in audio (podcast), display, etc. &#x20;



### Local Linear TV

* Ruth Hinson is the main contact, and Linda Vorenkamp
* In 2021 we shifted to buying on impressions for local; everything for purchasing will be on impressions CPM, but planning off of GRPs and cost per point (CPP).
  * **how does that conversion work, how would the client like to see it?**
* The flow chart still has GRPs/CPPs.  At the point of uploading buys and going-to-market, they have the strategy team convert them to impressions.
* There are monthly 'books'
* The **biweekly reporting** comes with a two-week lag
  * index by daypart by demo, and secondary demo
  * **can i see some examples?**
  * **is Biweekly Report distinct from Post Report?**
* **Post reporting** comes out 90 days after the quarter, all discrepancies are cleared at this point. (Example, they do weekly in ATL, they'll show the market delivery at 95%, but final is 80%)
  * **What is the usual trend here, can we provide some modified preliminary results based on booked delivery?**
* Weekly off of "LPM" and "Metered" markets
  * **Definition?**
* Local reporting is delayed because it comes at a DMA level
  * **Clarification?**

* Audio has been pulled from the plan - what remains?
