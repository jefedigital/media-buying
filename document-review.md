  * Paid Search** tCPA** = $67  (for Acquisition campaigns)
  * Paid Search **tROAS **= 250% (for Retention campaigns)\

* This year their  Paid Search / lower funnel allocation between Acquisition and Retention (targeting new vs existing customers) increased spend on Retention campaigns from 40/60 to 50/50 (enabled by better audience integration and development of retention-specific campaigns)\

* This year less investment in Affiliate 'Shop' (cashback, loyalty) and more toward Influencer and Content Commerce.   ('Shop' noted as a 'break glass' strategy in the notes)\

## lululemon\_Competitive\_Analysis\_3.5.2021

Produced by Zenith, located in Sharepoint **lululemon-Zenith / General**

This is a competitive analysis of media spend by brand; source is Kantar.&#x20;

#### **Identify Competitors (% of total spend)**

* Nike 32% $50M
* Adidas 22%
* UnderArmour 12%
* Amazon 13% (Category, not brand)
* Fabletics 8%
* Athtleta \[Gap] 5%
* Gymshark 3%
* lululemon 3% $5M
* Aerie 1%
* Alo 1%

Of all spend in this competitive set, 26% in Paid Social, 28% in Paid Search, 11% in Display.  Only 8% in Online Video and 5% in Network TV.

{% hint style="info" %}
**My Thoughts**:  Overall this analysis is very high level,  lululemon isn't really competing in the same tier as giants like Nike and Adidas.  More u**s**eful might be a more granular analysis of the brands they're currently stacked against, that level of detail may not be available from tools like Kantar.  (?)  &#x20;

May also be worth having a deeper analysis specific to Menswear (and any other audiences they're specifically chasing)

**Strangely I don't see a lot of talk so far specific to Men's ..  I was told this was their main focus. . true ??**

## lululemon media agency RFP

Created by lululemon; located in **lululemon-Zenith/Strategy-Planning/Briefs**

Business mix is primarily concentrated in one audience (women), market (North America) and category (women's bottoms). &#x20;

* **Unaided brand awareness** among females in the US is half of that compared to females in Canada
* **Share of market** among females in the US is one-third of that compared to Canada.
* Both metrics among males in the US and Canada is low compared to our activewear peers.

{% hint style="info" %}
These are big KPIs for the Meas Plan ..  **Unaided Brand Awareness** and **Share of Market  **..&#x20;

Brand Awareness (Brand Lift) will be provided by the Measurement Vendor about 6-8 weeks into the campaign.

Can we get Share of Market ..  how are we defining Market, by the way?
{% endhint %}

**Business Objectives **include:

* Increase unaided brand awareness in the US across genders (see chart)
* Close the gap between brand awareness and brand consideration across genders (see chart)

![Brand Metrics from RFP](.gitbook/assets/IMG\_0005.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
Here's something I have not heard mentioned .. check with Matt whether Brand Consideration will also be surveyed.   And, can we access the source of this chart, both for a fuller list of markets, and the specific percentages so we can establish benchmarks?
{% endhint %}

**Target Audience **definition

* Primary: Dual-gender in US, ages 18-49 with emphasis on key cities such as NYC, LA, Chicago, SF, Atlanta, Houston.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that SF appears to be their #1 market in terms of brand recognition and awareness.

## DM Measurement

**OOH Measurement**

Client's own overview of their Digital Marketing (DM) structure, platforms and strategy.  &#x20;

* ****[**GeoPath**](https://geopath.org)** **is considered best
* Nielsen also provides
* Others include DEC, Eyes On, TAB
* Mobile Data & Atttributtion (Ninth Decimal, Cuebiq) for foot traffic lift and brand studies.



**Measurement Plan**

* Interesting - mapped over the funnel (Awareness, Consideration, Buy, Retention, Advocacy)
